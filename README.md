# Othello

Hello,

This is my project depicting the game othello using a java swing.
This is the final version. I tried to test it as much as possible, but it may contain errors, for which I apologize in advance and I will be grateful for notifying them.


# IMPORTANT:

The project is no longer under development. I just updated the JDK version (8u121 to 16.0.1) and updated the syntax. Any version of JDK 16 should suffice for proper operation.

# GAME DESCRIPTION:

At the beginning, a small window with four checkboxes and three comboboxes will appear.

The first checkbox determines whether you want to play PVP or PVE.

The second checkbox determines if player two should start. (only for PVP)

The third checkbox specifies the reverse mode. (rules are the same, but the player with the lower score wins)

The first combobox determines the color of player one.

The second combobox determines the color of player two.

The third combobox determines the color of the highlight of a possible player's move.

To start, it is necessary that the colors of these comboboxes do not match!

The fourth combobox determines the difficulty. (only for PVE)

Press the play button to start the game.

The game is displayed in fullscreen, but you can easily switch to another program using ALT + TAB.

The program closes automatically when finished, but can be closed at any time using ESC.

In addition to the playing field (on the left side of the screen), the current time, date and day of the week are in the upper right corner.

Next to the playing field, two progressbars are displayed, which determine the score (below them, the color determines to which the given progressbar belongs). And the text on the right shows which player is currently on the turn.

The game runs as standard as the classic othello.

Have fun.
