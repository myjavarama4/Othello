# Othello

Board game othello in java swing updated to JDK 16.0.1. I tried to test the project as much as possible, but I apologize in advance for any mistakes. If you find one, please write it. Thank you and have fun.

PS. If you don't know the rules, you can find them here, for example. - https://www.ultraboardgames.com/othello/game-rules.php
